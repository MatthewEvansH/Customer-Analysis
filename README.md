## Potential Decisions Based on the Dashboard:
1. **Seasonal Promotions**: 
   Given the spike in December 2020, planning for promotional activities or event during this period can maximize revenue.

2. **Regional Focus**: 
   Invest in marketing and sales in high-revenue states like Texas, California, and Florida, while also exploring growth strategies for regions with lower contributions.

3. **Product Category Strategy**: 
   Increase inventory and marketing efforts for top categories (Mobiles & Tablets and Appliances) and analyze the potential to improve performance in lower-revenue categories.

4. **Targeted Marketing**: 
   Develop tailored marketing campaigns for the most lucrative age groups (30-40 and 60-70).

5. **Discount Optimization**: 
   Refine discount strategies to find the optimal balance that drives high order quantities without significantly eroding profit margins.
